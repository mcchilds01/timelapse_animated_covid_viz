A gif derived from OWID COVID data. The gif is initialized with 180 days-worth of png maps of covid infection rates, and with a built-in daily updater. The gif will be updated daily to incorporate the last 180 days of available COVID infection rate data. 

Fine-tuning of the gif appearance is a work in progress. 

Plan to next add code to automate production of interactive svg files of daily infection totals to accompany gifs
